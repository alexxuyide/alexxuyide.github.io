I participated in the reproduction of the climate change vulnerability score calculation for Malawi last week, following the Malcomb 2014 study. The result was not satisfactory, and I have identified several defects of the study while reproducing. I believe it is very important for us to reproduce and replicate social vulnerability models. A vulnerability model involves a wide range of data sources, and constructing it needs many subjective decisions. In order to evaluate the validity of a social vulnerability model, the foremost step is to see whether following the instructions provided by the author we would achieve the same results as those produced by the author. If there is too much ambiguity in the original model set-up, or we are unable to reproduce the exact values of the vulnerability score after carefully following its instructions, then we may not consider applying it in our study because the model is not trustworthy for us. 

If we get the same results, fortunately, then we have a clearer map of the internal structure and logic of the model. This knowledge would benefit us from appropriating it to our own study. To make the model work the best for us, we may need to tune some parameters, methods, or any subjective decisions we found when reproducing the original study. For example, we may consider using the same variables and data but alternating how scores are evaluated, on what scale the score is presented, etc. We have to be aware of the influence and effect of the calculated vulnerability score in reality, as an underestimation of vulnerability could be detrimental to an area. 

Reading Rufat et al.’s study on social vulnerability models for Sandy, I appreciate their effort in applying four different mainstream social vulnerability models: an inductive model based on factor analysis, a hierarchical weighted model based on expert knowledge, a deductive model composed of thematic pillars, and a profile approach based on clusters. Using multiple models and comparing their vulnerability results may result in fewer incidences of uncertainties and higher confidence in predicting places that could be vulnerable. 

To my disappointment, the study by Rufat et al. concludes with a negative note stating that there is a “mismatch between the rising application of social vulnerability models and understanding of their empirical validity”. The results of the mainstream models failed to coincide with the empirical disaster. I suppose there are too many variables that our existing data is unable to capture, and statistical reasonable analysis may still deviate from reality. Given the current background of global climate change and more frequent extreme weather events, past vulnerability models should be updated and re-evaluated to prevent high casualties during disasters.
